# OpenData4Health

Where to find what and who did what:
* **Summaries**
  * The poster is here above in [pdf](OpenData4Health-poster.pdf)
  * The video is here above and also shows the poster: [video](OpenData4Health-video.mp4)
  * [OpenData4Health.org](https://www.opendata4health.org) was created and the content is copied here above (OpenData4Health-web, redirection added at top of html)
* **Organization of files**
  * The "France" folder is really where all the data and code is. Three pieces of code are key:
    * AllCauseMortality byCity SMR calculation (to make the map with statistical over and under mortality) by Edouard Debonneuil
    * The CépiDC scraper in R in DiseaseRisks byDpt (the python scraper was abandonned) by Ayesha Kawser
    * The air pollution scraper in GreenOrNot by Pol Sans with major contributions
    * A code in ongoing to scrap images of cancer risks by canton, by Sylvain Sorrin
  * The data was searched and assembled by Edouard Debonneuil and, at least in terms of suggestions, by the organizers of Epidemium and of the challenge and Sébastien de Longeaux. The statistics for SMR where put in place with the help of Adrien Helary
* **Coupling of organizations**
  * The "animation" folder contains
    * A summary of Epidemium v1 and v2 data for such challenges
    * The animation of projects together ("GeoStatus") which lead to the coupling and synergy of NEOS and OpenDataForHealth
    * Items shared during meetings
  * The link with NEOS, to know how to use "X" adequately in mortality = f(X), was established with Pascal Dechaseaux, Sébastien de Longeaux, Rachel Aoronoff, Edouard Debonneuil. The following organisations helped promote the project: International Longevity Alliance (official communications), the organizers of Epidemium (official communications), NewClin (official communications), the World Talent Economic forum (invited Edouard Debonneuil to present). They also plan to take part in the project, as well as AGIR and HEALES.
* **Tools**
   * JOGL is how the first participants met
   * Facebook (/metaverse) and Yammer (an intranet alternative to Facebook) is how other participants met
      * A Facebook group OpenData4Health was created and the facebook group Epidemium was used also
   * Slack was much used as it permits to easily exchange about ongoing work and readings without much effort
   * A website, OpenDataForHealth.org was created, to highlight the work and show about the presence. It is currently hosted on online.fr, built with simple html and handled with FileZilla FTP client
   * GoogleDrive was first used as it provides a friendly space to coedit documents, but rapidly abandonned for github as the content was not accessible for all persons in the team
   * Zoom was used for exchanges, as well as the video calls embedded in Zoom and google meet
   * Whatsapp and text messages on phones completed exchanges on a one-to-one basis
   * R and python were used to scrap websites and images, compute indicators and build maps
* **References** (also names "Sources")
   * France/References.xlsx lists the sources used and to be further investigated
   * The website makes links to the original articles as well
   * Most important scientific articles or institutional presentations are in the folder France/References
