# OpenData4Health

Where to find what and who did what:
* **Summaries**
  * The poster is here above in three formats: [ppt](OpenData4Health-poster.pptx) [pdf](OpenData4Health-poster.pdf) [image](OpenData4Health-poster.png)
  * The video is here above and also shows the poster: [video](OpenData4Health-video.mp4)
  * [OpenData4Health.org](https://www.opendata4health.org) was created and the content is copied here above (OpenData4Health-web, redirection added at top of html)
* **Organization of files**
  * The "France" folder is really where all the data and code is. Three pieces of code are key:
    * AllCauseMortality byCity SMR calculation (to make the map with statistical over and under mortality) by Edouard Debonneuil
    * The CépiDC scrapper in R in DiseaseRisks byDpt (the python scrapper was abandonned) by Ayesha Kawser
    * The air pollution scrapper in GreenOrNot by Pol Sans with major contributions
    * A code in ongoing to scrapp images of cancer risks by canton, by Sylvain Sorrin
  * The data was searched and assembled by Edouard Debonneuil and, at least in terms of suggestions, by the organizers of Epidemium and of the challenge and NewClin. The statistics for SMR where put in place with the help of Adrien Helary
* **Coupling of organizations**
  * The "animation" folder contains
    * A summary of Epidemium v1 and v2 data for such challenges
    * The animation of projects together ("GeoStatus") which lead to the coupling and synergy of NEOS and OpenDataForHealth
    * Items shared during meetings
  * The link with NEOS, to know how to use "X" adequately in mortality = f(X), was established with Pascal Dechaseaux, Sébastien de Longeaux, Rachel Aoronoff, Edouard Debonneuil. The following organisations helped promote the project: International Longevity Alliance (official communications), the organizers of Epidemium (official communications), NewClin (official communications), the World Talent Economic forum (invited Edouard Debonneuil to present). They also plan to take part in the project, as well as AGIR and HEALES.
