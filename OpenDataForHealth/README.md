# OpenData4Health

A summary to appreciate who did what and where to find data is the following:
* Summaries
  * The same poster is in three formats: [ppt](OpenData4Health-poster.pptx) [pdf](OpenData4Health-poster.pdf) [image](OpenData4Health-poster.png)
  * Here is the video, that also shows the poster: [video](OpenData4Health-video.mp4)
  * The content of the website is copied here ("-web"): [html](OpenData4Health-web.html) (Of note, due to the github limits a redirection is introduced at the beginning of the html file for it to go to opendata4health.org)
* Organization of files and of work
  * The "animation" folder contains i) a summary of Epidemium v1 and v2 data for such challenges, ii) the animation of projects together ("GeoStatus") which lead to the coupling and synergy of NEOS and OpenDataForHealth, and items shared during meetings
  * The "France" folder is really where all the data and code is. Three pieces of code are key:
    * AllCauseMortality byCity SMR calculation (to make the map with statistical over and under mortality) by Edouard Debonneuil
    * the CépiDC scrapper in R in DiseaseRisks byDpt (the python scrapper was abandonned) by Ayesha Kawser
    * the air pollution scrapper in GreenOrNot by Pol Sans
    * A code in ongoing to scrapp images of cancer risks by canton, by Sylvain Sorrin
  * The data was assembled by Edouard Debonneuil
  * The link with NEOS, to know how to use "X" adequately in mortality = f(X), was established with Pascal Dechaseaux, Sébastien de Longeaux, Rachel Aoronoff
  * The statistics for SMR where put in place with the help of Adrien Helary
  * The following organisations helped promote the project: International Longevity Alliance (official communications), the organizers of Epidemium (official communications), NewClin (official communications), the World Talent Economic forum (invited Edouard Debonneuil to present). They also plan to take part in the project, as well as AGIR and HEALES.
