# OpenData4Health

This document provides details about where to find everything and who did what:
* **Summaries**
  * The poster is above and linked here as [pdf](OpenData4Health-poster.pdf)
  * The video is above and also linked here, showing the poster: [video](OpenData4Health-video.mp4)
  * [OpenData4Health.org](https://www.opendata4health.org) was created and the content is copied above and linked here (OpenData4Health-web, redirection added at top of html)
* **Organization of files**
  * The "France" folder above is the current repository for the main data and code. Three pieces of code are key:
    * AllCauseMortality byCity SMR calculation (to make the map with statistical over and under mortality) by Edouard Debonneuil
    * The CépiDC scraper in R in DiseaseRisks byDpt (the python scraper was abandonned) by Ayesha Kawser
    * The air pollution scraper in GreenOrNot by Pol Sans with major contributions
    * A code in ongoing to scrape images of cancer risks by canton, by Sylvain Sorrin
  * The data was searched and assembled by Edouard Debonneuil and, at least in terms of suggestions, by the organizers of Epidemium and of the challenge and NewClin. The statistics for SMR were collected and assembled with the help of Adrien Helary
* **Coupling of organizations**
  * The "animation" folder contains
    * A summary of Epidemium v1 and v2 data for such challenges
    * The animation of projects together ("GeoStatus") which led to the coupling and synergy of NEOS and OpenDataForHealth
    * Items shared during meetings
  * The link with NEOS, to know how to use "X" adequately in mortality = f(X), was established with Pascal Dechaseaux, Sébastien de Longeaux, Rachel Aronoff, Edouard Debonneuil. The following organisations helped promote the project: International Longevity Alliance (official communications), the organizers of Epidemium (official communications), NewClin (official communications), the World Talent Economic forum (invited Edouard Debonneuil to present). They also plan to take part in the on-going project, in addition to the Swiss association, AGiR!, and HEALES.
* **Tools**
 * JOGL was the platform where the first participants met and decided to collaborate.
 * Facebook (/metaverse) and Yammer (an intranet alternative to Facebook) is how other participants met and joined in.
    * A Facebook group OpenData4Health was created and the facebook group Epidemium was used also
 * Slack was also an essential tool, as it permits ready exchange about ongoing work and sharing articles and information without too much effort.
 * A website, OpenDataForHealth.org was created, to highlight the work and start developing an internet presence. It is currently hosted on online.fr, built with simple html by Edouard Debonneuil and handled with FileZilla FTP client
 * GoogleDrive has initially been used to collect information, as it provides simple tools to coedit documents, but was rapidly abandonned for github as the content was not accessible for all members of the team.
 * Zoom was used for live meetings, and also the video calls embedded in slack and google meet.
 * Whatsapp and text messages on phones completed exchanges on a one-to-one basis
 * R and python were used to scrape websites and images, compute indicators and build maps.
* **References** (also names "Sources")
 * France/References.xlsx lists the sources used, which will to be further investigated.
 * The website provides links to original articles, as well.
 * Most important scientific articles or institutional presentations can be found in the folder France/References.
